# 1.0.5
ADDED new keys to `commando.impl.utils/*execute-config*`. Added hooks keys
 - `:hook-execute-start` if not nil, call procedure at the start of `commando.core/execute` function.
 - `:hook-execute-end` if not nil, call procedure at the end of `commando.core/execute` function.

ADDED microsecs time measurement. All steps inside the `commando.core/execute` measure time. Every measurement adding to _status-map_ structure under `:stats` key.

UPDATED `status-map` structure. Was added two keys
 - `:uuid` autogenerated unique invocation identifier gotted everytime the function `commando.core/execute` were invoked
 - `:stats` contains vector of tuples like `["execute", 1085471, "1.085471ms"]` where `[<step-id>, <microsecs>, <formatted time>]`. Counts of steps depended from `*execute-config*` key `:debug-mode`.

UPDATED sort-commands-by-deps. Straightforward sets joining in base Kahn's algorithm was rewrited with in-degree counting optimization.

UPDATED build-deps-tree. Instead of searching dependency using the list of commandmaps by iterating across the list(O(n^2) in worst case), before starting to build a dependency graph, we quickly building a path-trie structure efficiently. This gave as fast way to resolve point/all-inside dependency only in O(n) time.

FIXED find-commands. StackOverflowException in case of long lists of dependencies in the one level.


# 1.0.4
ADDED commando.commands.builtin/commando-macro-spec. The new type of command that allow to group instructions by its functionality and use it as a single command. Added Readme information about the macro.

ADDED documentation for commando.commands.builtin commands. Now each built-in command have explanation of its behavior and examples of usage.

UPDATED upgrade commando.commands.query-dsl. Function `resolve-query` was removed and replaced by `resolve-fn`, `resolve-instruction`, `resolve-instruction-qe` function called a **resolvers**. Explanations about the resolvers added to _docs/query-dsl.md_ file.

UPDATED error serialization. `commando.impl.utils` contains new way to serialize errors for CLJ/CLJS. Now all errors are serialized to map with keys: `:type`, `:class`, `:message`, `:data` (if exists) and `:stacktrace` (if exists), `:cause` (if exists). See `commando.impl.utils/serialize-exception` for more information. You can expand the error handlers using `serialize-exception-fn` multimethod (but for CLJ only).

ADDED tests for macro-spec, errors and query-dsl changes.

UPDATED README.md 'Debugging section' was replaced on 'Configuring Execution Behavior' which contains more detailed information how to modify execution behavior.

UPDATED dynamic variable *debug-mode* replaced by the `*execute-config*` which is a map that can contain multiple configuration options.

FIXED Removed `detach-instruction-commands` call from `commando.core/build-compiler`. In `commando.core/build-compiler`, the line that detached instruction commands from the registry was removed. This means the compiled registry now includes internal commands (_map, _value, _vector).

# 1.0.3
UPDATED behavior `:validate-params-fn`. If the function return anything except `true` it ment validation failure. If the function return data, they will be attached to returned error inside status map. Added tests.

FIXED align serialization of exeption for CLJ/CLJS

ADDED function normalization for :commando/fn, :commando/apply, :commando/from commands. In CLJ it will acept the symbols,vars,functions,keywords. In CLJS acceptable is only function and keywords.

FIXED QueryDSL. QueryExpression passing by :keys and :strs(for string Instruction keys)

# 1.0.2
FIXED bug issue with silent status-map after error execution.

# 1.0.1
Update for cljdocs

# 1.0.0
First version of commando released publicly
